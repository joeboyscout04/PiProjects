##Alarm Clock
A 'gentle wakeup' alarm clock that uses the PiGlow.  It will slowly ramp up the brightness from 0-100%, starting with orange LEDs at wakeup-15, yellow LEDs at wakeup-10, and white LEDs at wakeup-5.  You will experience 100% brightness from these three colors for 20 minutes after the wakeup time, and then it will turn back off. 

Wakeup time configurable in the code.  It's setup to not turn on on the weekends (Saturday/Sunday morning).
